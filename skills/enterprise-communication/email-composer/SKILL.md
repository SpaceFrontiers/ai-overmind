## Best Practices

### Before Sending
- [ ] Clear subject line
- [ ] Correct recipients
- [ ] Appropriate tone
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Links work
- [ ] Attachments included
- [ ] Call to action clear
- [ ] Read out loud for flow

### After Sending
- Set reminders for follow-up
- Track if action required
- File for reference
- Update task list

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Unclear Subject**: "Update" or "Question" (too vague)
- **Missing Context**: Jumping into request without background
- **Too Long**: Multiple pages of text
- **No Action**: Unclear what recipient should do
- **Poor Timing**: Sending late Friday for Monday deadline
- **Wrong Tone**: Too casual with executives, too formal with peers
- **Passive Voice**: "Mistakes were made" vs "I made a mistake"
- **Jargon Overload**: Acronyms and terms reader may not know

## Research-Backed Communication Principles

### Writing Competency in Professional Settings
Research on business communication (Hines & Basso, 2009) reveals critical findings about professional writing:

**Grammar and clarity matter**:
- Entry-level professionals frequently lack thorough understanding of grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure
- **Passive voice weakens impact**: "Mistakes were made" vs "We made mistakes" - active voice creates accountability
- **Subject-verb agreement errors**: Most common when clauses/phrases separate subject and verb
- **Pronoun confusion**: Misuse of I/me/myself reflects poorly on credibility

**Business writing principles**:
- **Logical conclusion first**: Busy executives need the point upfront (not buried in middle/end)
- **Clear and concise prose**: Enables quick processing of message meaning
- **Expressive vs. elitist language**: Write to express ideas, not to impress with complexity
- **Plain language initiative**: Government and corporate push for clarity and efficiency

**Evidence-Based Takeaway**: Grammatical competency forges trust. Proper grammar avoids ambiguity and demonstrates professionalism.

### Effective Workplace Communication
Research on great workplaces (Great Place to Work Institute, 2011) demonstrates communication's impact:

**Communication affects credibility**:
- Good communication skills invite two-way dialogue
- Clear and informative managers reduce rumor spread
- Accessible managers allow employees to get needed information
- Open communication allows employees to meet expectations and be productive

**Generational communication differences**:
- **Traditionalists/Baby Boomers**: Prefer one-to-one communication
- **Gen X**: Want work calls only, respond to open-ended questions
- **Millennials**: Use online social media, expect frequent feedback, prefer teams

**Best practice**: At team formation, learn how members prefer to communicate. Bring everyone onto the same page for optimal productivity.

### Interpersonal Communication Quality
Research on workplace communication (Newson, 2010) highlights:

**Key elements of effective interpersonal communication**:
1. **Self-awareness**: Understanding your own communication style and biases
2. **Attentive listening**: More than hearing words - observing reactions and tone
3. **Sensitivity to others**: Recognizing emotional state and context
4. **Strategic silence**: Allowing space for reflection and processing

**The power of silence**:
- Gives speakers time to think and feel
- Creates space for reflection and problem-solving
- In grief/difficult news, presence matters more than words
- Uncomfortable at first, but powerful when mastered

**Practical Application**: In difficult email conversations, sometimes less is more. Know when brevity and directness serve better than lengthy explanations.
