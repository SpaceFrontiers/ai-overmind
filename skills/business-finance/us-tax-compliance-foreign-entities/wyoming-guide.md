- LLC can choose not to make distributions, limiting creditor recovery
- Creditor cannot force dissolution or sale of assets

**Wyoming Advantage**:
- Charging order is the **exclusive** remedy (even for single-member LLCs)
- Many other states allow creditors to foreclose on LLC interests
- Protects both personal assets from business liabilities and business assets from personal liabilities

Wyoming allows **Series LLCs**:

**Features**:
- One master LLC with multiple internal "series"
- Each series has separate assets, liabilities, members
- Liability of one series doesn't affect others
- File one formation document, pay one annual fee
- Each series can have different members, managers, purposes

**Use Cases**:
- Real estate investors (each property in separate series)
- Multiple business lines
- Asset segregation

**Caution**:
- Complex structure requiring professional guidance
- Not recognized in all states
- Tax treatment can be complicated

## Tax Optimization Strategies

### Wyoming LLC + Foreign Owner Structure

**Single-Member LLC** (Disregarded Entity):
```
Foreign Individual (NRA)
         ↓ (owns 100%)
    Wyoming LLC
         ↓
  US Business Operations
```

**Tax Treatment**:
- LLC is transparent for US tax purposes
- Income taxed to foreign owner on Form 1040-NR
- If no ECI (no US office/employees): Potentially no US tax on certain foreign-source income
- If ECI: Taxed at graduated rates (10-37%) with deductions
- Must file Form 5472 by April 15

**Multi-Member LLC** (Partnership):
```
Foreign Individuals/Entities
         ↓ (multiple owners)
    Wyoming LLC
         ↓
  US Business Operations
```

**Tax Treatment**:
- Partnership files Form 1065
- Issues K-1s to partners
- Partners pay tax on allocable share
- Section 1446 withholding: 37% (individuals), 21% (corps)
- More complex but allows profit-sharing flexibility

### C-Corporation Election

**When to Consider**:
- Reinvesting profits in business
- Seeking VC funding or planning exit/sale
- Want to retain earnings at 21% rate vs. 37% individual rate

**How to Elect**:
- File Form 8832 (Check-the-Box Election)
- Submit within 75 days of formation (or for next tax year)
- Cannot change back to partnership for 5 years

## Common Pitfalls for Foreign Owners

### 1. Forgetting Annual Report
- **Problem**: Automatic dissolution after 2 years of non-filing
- **Solution**: Set calendar reminder for anniversary month
- **Cost**: $100 reinstatement + back fees

### 2. No Operating Agreement
- **Problem**: Default state law applies; harder to prove ownership structure
- **Solution**: Create detailed operating agreement immediately
- **Cost**: $500-$2,000 attorney fee (or use template carefully)

### 3. Confusing Wyoming Fees with Federal Taxes
- **Problem**: Thinking $60 annual fee means no other obligations
- **Reality**: Must still file federal returns (Form 5472, 1040-NR, etc.)
- **Solution**: Understand federal vs. state obligations

### 4. Using PO Box for Registered Agent
- **Problem**: Wyoming requires physical street address
- **Solution**: Hire registered agent service with Wyoming address

### 5. Missing BOI Reporting Deadline
- **Problem**: $500/day penalty (up to $10,000)
- **Solution**: File BOI within 30 days of formation (2025 onwards)

### 6. Assuming Privacy = Tax Evasion
- **Problem**: Privacy protections don't eliminate tax obligations
- **Reality**: All income still reportable to IRS
- **Solution**: Maintain full tax compliance despite privacy

### 7. Not Maintaining Separation
- **Problem**: Mixing personal and business finances pierces corporate veil
- **Solution**: Separate bank accounts, proper documentation, arm's length transactions
